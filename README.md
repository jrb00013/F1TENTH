# F1TENTH Autonomous Racing üèÅ

This project includes multiple modules for an autonomous racecar.

##  Components:
- **Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)**
- **Wall Following**
- **Follow the Gap**
- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**
- **Motion Planning**
- **Perception & Vision / Planning**


## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install ROS2 (Foxy or Galactus).
4. Create the ROS2 Workspace.
5. Create a ROS2 Package inside the new workspace.
6. Build the package with colcon build. 
7. Run the specific scripts within ROS2 nodes to test each module.
8. Build your car, setting up the  Set up your sensors and a Jetson TX or another ai edge computing device. Deploy onto the hardware, run the ros2 nodes, and utilizie your control panel, interface, or controller to test the ROS2 node on the car.
9. Or you can use the RViz Simulation Tool, configure digital sensors and define mappings for a digital car.

## Requirements:

# Hardware / Physical Car Components
(you can buy a kit online from Penn Engineering at [!this link](https://racecarj.com/products/racecar-j-robot-f1-tenth-kit) through the University of Pennsylvania's website for around $1800 + another $1600 for the sensors and the NVIDIA Jetson as the kit does not include those components)

- 1-2 Battery Packs (5000‚ÄØmAh each) with a XT90 connector
- Traxxas RC Rally Car with a Laser-Cut chassis
- LIDAR Mounts
- LiDAR Sensors (Hokuyo is preferred)
- Brushless Motor
- a USB Hub
- Any Electronic Speed Controllers (VESC is preferred)
-  AI GPU Computing Platform / Device (prefferably an NVIDIA Jetson TX1/TX2), but you can use a simple computing device with less effiency and potential risks like a Raspberry PI if needed


# Software
- Python 3.x
- ROS2 Foxy, Galactus (Robot Operating System)
